# Trip Planner

The Trip Planner, an application meticulously crafted with fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms at its core. The project aims to develop an integrated travel planning and budgeting system that allows users to find the shortest path between destinations, create an activity schedule based on priorities, and manage expenses within a budget.

## Implementation
* **Graph Operations:** To represent a map of destinations using a graph and utilise Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between user-defined source and destination locations.

* **Activity Scheduling:** To implement a scheduling system using a binary search tree which allows users to insert activities with specified priorities and durations and displays the scheduled activities in priority order.

* **Itinerary Management:** To organise the trip itinerary using a linked list and allow them to add activities to the itinerary. Finally, display the itinerary.

* **Budget Management:** To track and manage expenses using a priority queue and allow users to set a budget and prioritise spending based on expense amounts. In the end, display the total spent and remaining within the budget.
